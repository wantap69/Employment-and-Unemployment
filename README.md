📊 Analyzing Employment and Unemployment Drivers in NCR, Philippines
## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores the key factors contributing to employment and unemployment in the *National Capital Region (NCR)* of the Philippines. By examining labor force data, we aim to understand which *economic sectors and sub-sectors* drive employment, and whether *educational attainment* has a measurable impact on *wages and unemployment rates*.

This analysis is particularly relevant for policymakers, educators, and job seekers aiming to understand the evolving labor landscape in NCR.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify the distribution of employment across major sectors and sub-sectors.
- Determine which sectors and sub-sectors contribute the most to NCR's employment.
- Examine the association between *educational attainment and unemployment status*.
- Analyze the correlation between *educational attainment and wage levels*.
